# Asteroid

## TODO
- Transitions, currently the transitions are hardcoded this is because i couldnt find a way to make them good to use.
- Web, FNA (Similar to MonoGame) has a web integration so its possible to run the game on the web.
- Deactivated and Activated methods when the user clicks away from the game.
